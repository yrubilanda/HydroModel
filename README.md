# HydroModel

This Jupyter Notebook contains hydrological analysis and modeling tools designed for archaeological or environmental applications. It was originally developed as part of research exploring hydrological systems and water resource modeling, using Python and spatial data.

üîç Overview
The notebook includes code and methods for:

Importing and processing spatial datasets (e.g., shapefiles, rasters).

Performing hydrological calculations or spatial overlays.

Generating visualizations to support data interpretation.

While the exact details of the code are embedded in the notebook, this repository is meant to serve as a foundational toolkit for hydro-related spatial analysis and modeling in Python.
